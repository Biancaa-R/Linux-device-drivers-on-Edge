# Linux-device-driver-
A simple linux device driver that can be run on both x86 and edge device (specifically most compatible with Raspberry Pi) as Rpi 's OS is easier to configure

note: GPIO drivers are specific to Rpi / Any other SBC with similar numbering

## üß© Overview
This project contains Linux kernel modules developed from scratch for the Raspberry Pi 4B. It includes:
- A basic character device driver
- A GPIO control module for toggling LEDs via sysfs

Designed to demonstrate low-level interaction with Linux kernel space using `loadable kernel modules` (LKM), targeting embedded systems and hardware-near control.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack
- Platform: Raspberry Pi 4B (64-bit Debian OS)
- Language: C
- Kernel Version: 5.x
- Interfaces: `insmod`, `sysfs`, `udev`, `/dev/`
- Tools: `make`, `modprobe`, `dmesg`, `cat`, `echo`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Registers a custom char device in `/dev/rpi_drv`
- Supports basic `open`, `read`, `write`, `close` ops
- Controls a user-defined GPIO pin via sysfs
- Cleanly handles `module_init` and `module_exit`

# Setup:
1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt upgrade -y
3. sudo apt install -y raspberrypi-kernal-headers
   
   // for installing the kernal headers
4. sudo apt install -y build-essential 
5. sudo reboot
   
   //for opening of a fresh kernel
   
// 4. is necessary as we are running c scripts therefore it requires gcc , make (most probably preinstalled)

Then check the conents of the build folder:

# Loading and unloading:

the generated .ko file can be used to load/ unload the kernel module (lkm):

# Number:
* for chosing of a number , it should be a number that was not listed in ls proc/devices
* Kernel modules can register block or character devices (in the traditional unix sense, "device" is a word with many meanings) in the kernel, using a routine like register_blkdev together with a string that is supposed to identify the device.
*  It's possible to use any string for that purpose, and these strings show up in the /proc/devices file (which is just a textual representation of this kernel table).
* //which are different from the major and minor numbers shown in /dev

* After the generation of device number and loading , it can be checked by
*  cat /proc/devices | grep my_device_nr

$ ls /dev/ -al

shows the device in the list after the creation of the node . cat /proc/devices doesnt confirm the device creation (node) only the number associted.

# Reading after the creation of device:

So the loading of the .ko file (lkm) of the corresponding device is necessary for the accessing of that device for either read/write

* initially when the corresponding kernel module for major no. 90 was not loaded but for 104 , it is unable to access the file.

# Read Write :

shows the output response when the read_write LKM is loaded into the kernel.

So a dummy driver with a major number of 234, minor 0 is registered in the list of device drivers.

command.
